        Swift released her tenth studio album, Midnights, on October 21, 2022, to critical praise and commercial success.In 2023, she released two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), as part of her "Taylor's Version" re-recording project after a dispute over the ownership of her first six studio albums.Both re-recordings were released amidst Swift's sixth headlining concert tour, the Eras Tour.At the 66th Annual Grammy Awards on February 4, 2024, Swift won Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year for Midnights. During her acceptance speech for the former category, she announced The Tortured Poets Department as a new original studio album that she had worked on since 2022. This announcement was met with surprise from her fans, who had anticipated her to announce the re-recording of her 2017 album, Reputation, based on her social media clues.
        
        Swift began conceiving the album immediately after submitting Midnights to her record label, Republic Records, and continued working on it in secret throughout the U.S. leg of the Eras Tour in 2023.While she was creating the album, her dating life continued to be a widely covered topic in the press, who reported on Swift's relationships with Joe Alwyn, Matty Healy, and Travis Kelce.At the Eras Tour concerts in Melbourne in February 2024, Swift said that The Tortured Poets Department was a "lifeline" for her and an album that she "really needed" to make,reflecting on how it made her confirm that songwriting was an integral part of her life. In an Instagram post, Swift described the album as "an anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in timeâ€”one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure".</p>
