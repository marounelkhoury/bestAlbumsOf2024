    <h2>Background<b></b></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The band described Frog in Boiling Water as "more or less a collection of snapshots from various angles of our modern condition which we think highlights what this collapse looks like and, more particularly, what it feels like". The title is taken from Daniel Quinn's 1996 novel The Story of B.
