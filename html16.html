    <p><b><i>The Great Impersonator</i></b> is the fifth studio album by American singer Halsey, released on October 25, 2024, by Columbia Records, marking her first release with the label. Her first full-length release since If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power (2021), Halsey conceived it as a confessional concept album believing it would be her last project after being diagnosed with lupus and a T cell lymphoproliferative disorder. It contains reflections about Halsey's personal struggles with life and death. Musically, it encompasses pop, folk, and subgenres of rock, with references to music from previous decades.

        Halsey wrote and co-produced The Great Impersonator with several collaborators, including Alex G, Michael Uzowuru, Greg Kurstin, Tyler Johnson, and Emile Haynie. The album was initially teased with the promotional single "The End". It was supported by the lead single "Lucky", which was followed by "Lonely Is the Muse", "Ego", and "I Never Loved You". As part of the album's promotion, the singer impersonated musicians and public figures that inspired the songs.
        
        Receiving positive reviews from music critics, the album's raw nature and honesty as well its eclectic sound were praised. The Great Impersonator debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, becoming Halsey's fifth consecutive record to chart within the top two. It has also reached the top 20 in Australia, Canada, Scotland, and the United Kingdom.

    <p>I made this record in the space between life and death. And it feels like I've waited an eternity for you to have it. I'll wait a bit longer. I've waited a decade, already. - Halsey prior to the release of the album.

        The album's release was intended to be the same day as the anniversary of Room 93 (2014), though it was moved up by two days. It was recorded from 2022 to 2024 when she was struggling with her lupus and T-cell disorder diagnoses as well as birth of son Ender. Halsey stated she believed it would "be the last album [she] ever made." Various producers have been credited between the three tracks released.
        The album focuses on exploring Halsey's authenticity and relationships and her interpretation of their resonance with various contexts. This includes exploring how her music would have sounded in different decades, from the 1970s to the 2000s. Halsey expressed that, after her diagnoses, she felt detached from her body, as if she was "impersonating" herself, thus coming up with the concept and references for the album.
