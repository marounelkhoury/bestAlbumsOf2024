    <p><b><i>Charm</i></b> is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Clairo, released on July 12, 2024. The follow-up to her second album, Sling (2021), it is her first self-released studio album after her previous two albums were released by Fader and Republic respectively. Clairo produced the album alongside Leon Michels with musical contributions from Nick Movshon, Homer Steinweiss, Marco Benevento, and Dave Guy, among others.

        Charm received critical acclaim, with music critics praising its production, songwriting and Clairo's musical expansion. Commercially, it debuted at number 8 on the US Billboard 200, becoming her first top 10 album. Although never released as a single, the track "Juna" topped the TikTok Billboard Top 50 chart in early August, after gaining traction on TikTok upon the album's release.
        
        At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, Charm received a nomination for Best Alternative Music Album. This marks Clairo's first Grammy nomination.

    <p>In January 2024, Clairo started teasing a new album with a post on Instagram, captioning it "maybe this year". In March, she shared an Instagram post captioned with emojis depicting the number three, a check mark, and a purple heart. The post was interpreted by music publication The Forty-Five to mean that her third studio album was complete. On May 7, she revealed a release date of May 23 for her new music via Instagram Stories.

        On May 23, Clairo announced that the album, titled Charm and produced by Leon Michels, was scheduled for release on July 12, while releasing its lead single, "Sexy to Someone". A press release accompanying the announcement of Charm described the album as "a collection of warm, '70s-inspired grooves that move lithely between jazz, psychedelic folk and soul".
