    <p><b><i>Cowboy Carter</i></b> (also referred to as Act II: Cowboy Carter) is the eighth studio album by American singer and songwriter Beyoncé, released on March 29, 2024, via Parkwood Entertainment and Columbia Records. A concept album, Cowboy Carter is the second of a planned trilogy of albums, following Renaissance (2022). Beyoncé conceived Cowboy Carter as a journey through a reinvention of Americana, spotlighting the overlooked contributions of Black pioneers to American musical and cultural history.

        Mostly labeled a country and Americana album, Cowboy Carter blends together diverse Southern sub-genres that Beyoncé listened to when growing up in Texas, including zydeco, rock and roll, folk, rhythm and blues, pop, psychedelic soul, hip-hop and bluegrass. Conceptually, the album is presented as a radio broadcast, with country singers Dolly Parton, Linda Martell, and Willie Nelson acting as disc jockeys. The album's songs feature rising Black country artists such as Shaboozey, Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, Reyna Roberts, and Willie Jones. The music is driven by a range of acoustic instruments played by musicians including Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, Nile Rodgers, Jon Batiste, and Rhiannon Giddens.
        
        Cowboy Carter was met with universal acclaim and appeared on multiple year-end lists; critics felt that the album's genre experimentation, expansive scope, and eclectic references aided an ambitious reimagining of Americana and country through the lens of their Black roots. The album increased the listenership of country music, drove cultural conversations on Black musicians' place within the genre, boosted the careers of rising country artists, and increased the popularity of Western wear and culture. At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, Cowboy Carter earned eleven nominations (including Album of the Year and Best Country Album), making it the third-most nominated album in Grammy history.
        
        Cowboy Carter debuted at number one in several countries and broke certain chart and streaming records. In the United States, Cowboy Carter became Beyoncé's eighth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200 and the first album by a black woman to top the Top Country Albums chart. The album was supported three singles, "Texas Hold 'Em", "16 Carriages" and "II Most Wanted", with the first becoming Beyoncé's ninth U.S. number-one single and the first country song by a Black woman to top the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs charts.

    <h2>Background<b></b></h2>
    <hr>
    <p><b><i>Cowboy Carter</i></b> was over five years in the making. Beyoncé began to write the album in 2019, then recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic, which she described as her most creative period. The album forms "Act II" of a trilogy project that Beyoncé recorded during this period. The first act, Renaissance (2022), is primarily a house and disco record highlighting and celebrating the Black progenitors of dance music, leading some to believe that each album of the trilogy would aim to explore the Black roots of a different musical genre. Cowboy Carter was originally intended to be released before Renaissance, but Beyoncé changed the order in response to the pandemic.

        Between 2020 and 2024, Dolly Parton often said that she would like Beyoncé to cover her song "Jolene". She said that "the song has been recorded worldwide over 400 times in lots of different languages", but she always wanted to hear Beyoncé make the song like a "powerhouse", in the same vein as Whitney Houston's cover of "I Will Always Love You".
