    <p>In September 2022, following the release of Cabello's third album, Familia in April of the same year, it was announced she had departed from Epic Records and signed to Universal Music Group's label, Interscope Records.

        Cabello appeared in an interview by Alexandra Cooper of Call Her Daddy, where she revealed her album is "really sitting in the discomfort of things and realizing there's not gonna be a neat, in-a-box answer. I feel strong in these ways, weak in these ways, and there's no real clear answer here. But the album process has been such a journey. It started out with me having that intention of going back to how it started for me, which was just sitting with myself and really getting back to that first passion of songwriting. Nerding out over references and artists and poetry—whatever—and really tapping into that."
        
        In an interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe, Cabello described the album's sonic departure from her previous works, crediting Pablo "el Guincho" Díaz-Reixa and Jasper Harris with assisting her in the departure. She revealed: "I do feel like I'm a weirdo, and that's the music that I love, and that's the music that I feel the most proud of making. I think a lot of times it comes to finding people that are weirdos too, and Jasper's a weirdo, Guincho's a weirdo, and I think the three of us were able to just keep it in this bubble of like, we don't give a fuck, and we're just going to do what we think is fire."</p>
