    <p>On February 16, 2024, Clark first spoke about the record, saying how she "needed to go deeper in finding [her] own sonic vocabulary" and referring to the album as "post-plague pop". All Born Screaming marks the first studio album entirely produced by Clark herself, alongside additional mixing by Cian Riordan. The record features contributions from Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters, Cate Le Bon, Justin Meldal-Johnsen, Josh Freese, Stella Mozgawa of Warpaint, Rachel Eckroth, Mark Guiliana, and David Ralicke of Dengue Fever. Trying to explain the sound of the album, Clark compared it to "taking the long walk into the woods alone" in order to find the messages of your heart. As a result, she opined that it "sounds real because it is real".</p>
