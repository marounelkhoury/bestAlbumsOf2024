    <p><b><i>Chromakopia</i></b> is the eighth studio album by American rapper Tyler, the Creator. It was released through Columbia Records on October 28, 2024, serving as the follow-up to Call Me If You Get Lost (2021). Chromakopia was written, produced, and arranged by Tyler himself. The album features guest appearances from Daniel Caesar, Doechii, GloRilla, LaToiya Williams, Lil Wayne, Childish Gambino, Solange, Lola Young, Santigold, Schoolboy Q, Sexyy Red, Thundercat, and Teezo Touchdown, with physical releases of the album additionally featuring Playboi Carti.

        The album blends different genres like hip-hop, jazz, and soul, evocative of Tyler's previous releases Flower Boy (2017) and Igor (2019). Conceptually, Chromakopia is narrated by Tyler's mother, Bonita Smith, as a diary that pieces together Tyler's perspective on past timeline experiences separated by tracks. The album received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the lyricism, cohesiveness, and production, and even noted its messy and confusing nature as a positive.
        
        Chromakopia was supported by its lead single, "Noid", as well as two promotional singles, from "St. Chroma" and "Thought I Was Dead". The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one in eight countries. In the United States, the album debuted at the top of the Billboard 200, earning Tyler his third US number-one album and is his fastest-selling album to date. Several other songs from the album also charted on the Billboard Hot 100, such as "Noid" and "St. Chroma". In support of the album, Tyler will embark on the Chromakopia: The World Tour (2025).

    <p>On October 28, 2024, during Tyler, the Creator's Chromakopia exclusive listening event, Tyler revealed the meaning behind the album, noting that the album was originally about him growing up in Hawthorne, Inglewood. He revealed on stage that "no one knows anything about me from before I was like 17" and that the record turned into Tyler "taking a bunch of shit my mom told me as a kid." Tyler uploaded a video on his official YouTube channel titled "MASK IS OFF: CHROMAKOPIA" on November 12, 2024, which chronicles the creative process of the album, including behind-the-scenes clips from composition sessions, instrumentation arrangements and engineering work.</p>
