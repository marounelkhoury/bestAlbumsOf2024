    <p><strong><i>The FORCE </i> </strong> (an acronym for Frequencies of Real Creative Energy) is the fourteenth studio album by American rapper and actor LL Cool J, released on September 6, 2024, by LL Cool J, Inc., Def Jam Recordings, and Virgin Music Group. It is LL Cool J's first official studio album in over eleven years since his 2013 predecessor, Authentic, released equally as his first under his vanity label, LL Cool J, Inc., and his first by Def Jam since 2008's Exit 13.[2] It features guest appearances from Snoop Dogg, Fat Joe, Rick Ross, Sona Jobarteh, Saweetie, Busta Rhymes, Nas, Eminem, Mad Squablz, J-S.A.N.D., and Don Pablito.[3]

    The album is almost entirely produced by Q-Tip, who provides additional vocals on the bulk of the album, and had been involved in the development of the project since late 2020.[4][1] The album also features additional production from the album's guest stars Eminem and Sona Jobarteh, with J-S.A.N.D. producing the album's final track alongside Kizzo.</strong></b></i></th>

    <p>The album was originally set for development in the summer of 2014 under the title GOAT 2, alluding to it being a sequel to LL Cool J's 2000 number-one album G.O.A.T.During 2015, he went idle from music to focus on acting (NCIS: Los Angeles)and hosting (Lip Sync Battle).
    
        In March 2016, he announced his intentions to retire from recording music to focus more on his acting career.After negative feedback from fans, LL would later retract his announcement, and decided to scrap the original album and create a new one.In 2019, it was announced that LL Cool J and former labelmate DMX (who would later die in 2021)[10] re-signed with Def Jam Recordings for their upcoming albums to be released.No follow-ups were heard of LL's album afterwards until March 2022, when he confirmed on Instagram that producer Q-Tip was assigned to produce a majority of the album.
        
        On February 22, 2023, LL playfully reminded his social media followers that his album was scrapped because "it was too hot", before instating that it was "not yet worthy of a release" that year.That March, he and various artists embarked on a promotional tour leading up to the release of the album.On July 12, 2024, in celebration for the fortieth anniversary of the founding of his label, Def Jam, he announced the newly-titled The FORCE, claiming that he "had to learn how to rap again".
        
        On July 22, the album's track list was revealed.</p>
