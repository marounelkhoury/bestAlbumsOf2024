    <p><b><i>GNX</i></b> is the sixth studio album by American rapper Kendrick Lamar. It was surprise-released on November 22, 2024, through PGLang and Interscope Records. The album features guest appearances from SZA, Dody6, Lefty Gunplay, Wallie the Sensei, Siete7x, Roddy Ricch, AzChike, Hitta J3, YoungThreat, and Peysoh. Production was primarily handled by Sounwave and Jack Antonoff, alongside Mustard, Sean Momberger, and Kamasi Washington, among others. Titled after the Buick Regal model and following his feud with Canadian musician Drake, GNX is Lamar's first album to be released after his departure from longtime labels Top Dawg Entertainment and Aftermath Entertainment.

        GNX was released to widespread critical acclaim and debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, giving Lamar his fifth number-one album. It also topped the charts in numerous countries including Canada, Netherlands, Sweden, Australia, Denmark and the UK. It was supported by three singles: "Squabble Up", "TV Off", and "Luther". Lamar and SZA will additionally embark on the Grand National Tour in 2025 to further promote the album.

    <p>Kendrick Lamar released his fifth studio album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers, on May 13, 2022, to critical and commercial success. After concluding The Big Steppers Tour in March 2024, Lamar shared on social media that he had purchased a vintage, limited-run 1987 Buick Grand National Experimental (GNX), the same model that his father used to take him home from the hospital following his birth.

        Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers was Lamar's last album with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE), to which he had signed in 2005. Before his feud with Canadian rapper Drake re-escalated, he quietly departed from Aftermath Entertainment and signed a direct licensing agreement with its distributor, Interscope Records. Lamar released five standalone singles during the latest installment of their conflict, including the Billboard Hot 100-toppers "Like That" and "Not Like Us". The rapper teased a then-untitled song in the beginning of the music video for the latter. Entertainment Weekly observed its inclusion and fan speculation that it could be included in his next album; the song was revealed to be "Squabble Up".
