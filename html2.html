    <p><i><b>Short n' Sweet</i></b> is the sixth studio album by American singer Sabrina Carpenter. It was released on August 23, 2024, through Island Records. Primarily a pop record with country, disco, rock, and R&B influences, Short n' Sweet was produced by Julian Bunetta, John Ryan, Ian Kirkpatrick, and Jack Antonoff.

        The album explores Carpenter's love life and her perspectives on 2020s dating. Its title is a reference to the emotional impact of Carpenter's shortest romantic relationships, as well as her short stature and the album's brief runtime. Carpenter stated that Short n' Sweet is her second "big girl" album, feeling complete creative control of her music starting from Emails I Can't Send (2022), her first album with Island Records.
        
        As her first Platinum-certified album and number-one record in the United States, Short n' Sweet is Carpenter's first major success. Two singles, "Espresso" and "Please Please Please", preceded the album's release; both topped the Billboard Global 200 chart and exposed Carpenter to wider commercial success. "Espresso" marked Carpenter's first number-one song on the UK Singles Chart, whereas "Please Please Please" marked her first number-one song on the US Billboard Hot 100. The third single "Taste" peaked at number one in the UK and number two in the US. Short n' Sweet topped the record charts in 18 countries, including Australia, France, the UK and the US. It placed all of its 12 songs on the US Hot 100 chart as well. To support the album, Carpenter embarked on the Short n' Sweet Tour, the first arena tour of her career, in September 2024.
        
        Upon release, Short n' Sweet received positive reviews from music critics, who praised the confidence of the lyrics and the music's enjoyability, though some criticized the songwriting as serviceable and low-risk. Short n' Sweet and its songs received eight nominations at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, including an Album of the Year nomination. Carpenter became one of the fifteen artists in history who have earned Grammy nominations in all four main General Field categories in one night.
