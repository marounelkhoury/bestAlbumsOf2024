    <p><b><i>Deeper Well</i></b> is the sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter Kacey Musgraves. It was released on March 15, 2024, through MCA Nashville and Interscope Records. The album was preceded by the release of two singles: the title track and "Too Good to Be True". To support Deeper Well, Musgraves embarked on the Deeper Well World Tour in April 2024.

        Commercially, the album became her best project in terms of sales in the first week of sales worldwide. In the United States, it debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, while debuting at number three in the United Kingdom on the Official Albums Chart, becoming the singer's highest entry on both charts. An expanded edition of the album, Deeper into the Well, was released in August 2024.

    <p> Musgraves teased the project on February 4, 2024, during a 66th Annual Grammy Awards commercial titled "My Saturn Has Returned". The eponymous lead single was released with an accompanying music video alongside the album announcement days later on February 8. Inspiration for the song came through change in feelings and sentiments that might be off-putting at first but equips one with "new insight and deeper love somewhere else". It was followed by the second single, "Too Good to Be True", on February 29. The music video of the song premiered later on March 15, the same day the album was officially released. A digital deluxe edition of the album, containing the bonus track "Ruthless", was available during the album's release week. On July 26, Musgraves released the single "Irish Goodbye" and announced an expanded version of the album, subtitled Deeper into the Well, which was released on August 2. Its release was accompanied by farmer's market pop-up shops in four cities in the US. The Deeper into the Well tracks were released independently on vinyl as part of Record Store Day Black Friday 2024, backed with 20 minutes of woodland sounds.
