    <p><b><i>One Hand Clapping</i></b> is a live-in-studio album by the Britishâ€“American rock band Paul McCartney and Wings, released on 14 June 2024, nearly fifty years after it was recorded.

        The album began as a rockumentary starring Paul McCartney and his then-band, Wings, and directed by David Litchfield. It was recorded over four days in August 1974 at Abbey Road Studios in London. The film features the band performing live in the studio and recording a potential live album, as well as voice-over interviews with the band members. Songs featured include numerous McCartney, Wings and Beatles hits, as well as some covers. Although a TV sales brochure was made, the film and album went unreleased at the time. In the decades since, they have been frequently bootlegged, and various tracks have been released on special editions of other McCartney and Wings albums. The film was finally released on 2 November 2010 as part of the box set reissue of Band on the Run, the first release in the Paul McCartney Archive Collection.
        
        It was announced in August 2024 that the film had been remastered in 4K, and was released in cinemas on 26 September 2024.

    <hr>
    <p>The performance was recorded in Abbey Road Studios (known at the time as EMI Studios) over four days in August 1974, during Band on the Run's seventh week in a row at the top of the UK album charts. Paul McCartney, Linda McCartney and guitarist Denny Laine were joined by new members guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Geoff Britton, who were recruited after previous members Henry McCullough and Denny Seiwell had left just prior to recording Band on the Run. The band had just returned from Nashville, where they recorded their then-upcoming single "Junior's Farm". The band were also joined in the studio by orchestra conductor Del Newman and saxophonist Howie Casey, both of whom had previously played with McCartney and would go on to join the Wings touring band.

        The film was abandoned until it was released in 2010 in the box set reissue of Band on the Run as part of Paul McCartney Archive Collection.
