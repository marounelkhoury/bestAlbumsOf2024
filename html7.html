    <p><strong><i>Eternal Sunshine </i> </strong>is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Ariana Grande. It was released on March 8, 2024, by Republic Records. It is her first new album in over three years, following the release of Positions (2020). Written and produced by Grande, Max Martin, Ilya Salmanzadeh, and Oscar GÃ¶rres amongst others, Eternal Sunshine is a pop and R&B record with dance, synth-pop and house influences, characterized by mid-tempo synthesizers, subtle guitar and string elements.

        Grande derived the album's title from the 2004 American film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. She conceived the album as a record of both vulnerability and entertainment, inspired by her personal life experiences. Upon release, the album received acclaim from critics for its restrained vocals and music, and the emotional vulnerability of the subject matter, while some critiqued the songwriting as unrefined. Eternal Sunshine and its singles were nominated for three Grammy Awards, including for Best Pop Vocal Album.
        
        In the United States, the album opened at number one on the Billboard 200, marking her sixth number-one on the chart, while charting all of its tracks on the Billboard Hot 100. Three singles were released from the album; the first two, "Yes, And?" and "We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)", debuted atop the Hot 100, making Grande the woman with the most number-one debuts and the first woman with two albums to produce multiple number-one debuts in the US. Eternal Sunshine topped the record charts in thirteen other countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Grande promoted and discussed the album on programs hosted by Zach Sang, Zane Lowe, Penn Badgley, and Sean Evans, and was the musical guest of Saturday Night Live on March 9, 2024. She performed music from the album at the 2024 Met Gala and on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.
        
        The standard edition of Eternal Sunshine does not contain guest musical acts, but features spoken words from Grande's maternal grandmother Marjorie Grande on "Ordinary Things" and astrologer Diana Garland on "Saturn Returns Interlude". Two extended editions of the album, including remixes and versions of several tracks from the standard album, were released on March 10 and October 1, 2024. The additional tracks feature Australian singer Troye Sivan and American singers Mariah Carey, Brandy, and Monica.</i></b> </p>
