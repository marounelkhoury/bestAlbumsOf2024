    <p><b><i>Imaginal Disk</i></b> is the second studio album by the American musical duo Magdalena Bay, released through Mom + Pop Music on August 23, 2024. Both members of the duo, Mica Tenenbaum and Matthew Lewin, entirely wrote and produced the album, while Tenenbaum provided the lead vocals. It is a concept album centered on the fictional character True. After a compact disc-shaped object, homonymous with the album, is implanted into her forehead in order to create her ideal self, her body rejects it and she relearns the meaning of being human. Recurring lyrical themes include self-exploration and consciousness.

        Musically, Imaginal Disk is a synth-pop, dance-pop, and electronic rock album. It was supported by four singles—"Death & Romance", "Image", "Tunnel Vision", and "That's My Floor"—released between May and August 2024; three of them were accompanied by Peter Gabriel-influenced music videos that follow the narrative of the album, with the vocalist portraying True. Magdalena Bay further promoted it with a concert tour, the Imaginal Mystery Tour, which commenced in September 2024.
        
        Upon release, the album received acclaim from music critics. Most of the reviewers praised its style and considered it an improvement from their debut album, Mercurial World (2021). It appeared on several year-end listicles of the best music, as well as on a mid-decade ranking by Paste. The same magazine also named "Death & Romance" the best song released in 2024. Commercially, Imaginal Disk reached secondary charts in the United Kingdom and the United States.

    <hr>
    <p>In 2021, the American duo Magdalena Bay—consisting of Mica Tenenbaum and Matthew Lewin—released their debut album Mercurial World to critical acclaim. In the following year, they shared its deluxe edition, which contained alternative versions of album tracks and new songs. It was released through Luminelle Recordings. While promoting the album with a concert tour, they started working on new music. In parallel, they worked with Jihyo and Lil Yachty, and released Mini Mix, Vol. 3, an extended play (EP) with seven short songs accompanied by a full-length music video. In June 2023, the duo signed to the New York City-based record label Mom + Pop Music. In a statement, they expressed their excitement for "what the future holds", and announced that "the next stage, the next phase is here". Following a series of social media posts teasing the arrival of new music in 2024, Magdalena Bay announced their second album, Imaginal Disk.
