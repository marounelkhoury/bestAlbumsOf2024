    <p><i><b>The Loneliest Girl in the World </i></b>is a perfect cocktail of heartfelt storytelling, angelic vocals and genre-blending sound, it’s an intoxicating country-pop mixology that will get listeners buzzing along from top to bottom.</p>
   <p>“She could have made it to the altar, but she’s not the kind of bitch you can alter,” Laci Kaye Booth sings on the title track of her debut album, The Loneliest Girl in the World. The collection serves as a strong introduction to the rising artist, each track showcasing her ability to weave together personal narratives with a blend of country and pop influences.

    Over the course of 14 songs, Booth's evocative vocals exude a compelling blend of vulnerability and depth, complementing her storytelling lyrics with a distinct vintage flair. Unlike many of today’s top songs, designed to cater to algorithms, The Loneliest Girl in the World opts for crafting full narratives that give listeners the chance to get acquainted with Booth as an artist. The one-minute ‘Intro’ sets a nostalgic tone, incorporating voice memos and adding another intimate layer to the already personal effort.</p>
    <h2><b>Background</b></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>In the bridge of her debut album’s opening track, “Cigarettes,” Laci Kaye Booth sings/shouts, “I learned sometimes your first don’t last, I learned to scream, I learned to laugh, I learned to live with my regrets, I learned I hate, I hate cigarettes.” Quickly, you realise this woman with the Rapunzel-like golden locks, pillowy lips, and doe-eyes, is made of steely determination – and will take no prisoners when it comes to making her art.

        f Booth’s name sounds familiar, it’s because she finished in the Top 5 of American Idol’s 17th season (which premiered in 2019). Off the back of this success, Booth signed to Big Machine, where she released her self-titled EP, but was quickly dropped by the label. In “Cigarettes,” Booth gives a nod to that experience, singing, “And the same champagne that they bought me, I popped it when they dropped me.”Booth is now comfortably ensconced at Geffen Records, and recently released her debut album, The Loneliest Girl in the World, a soulful country record produced by Ben West. The record is a breath of fresh air in a genre dominated by mediocre bro-country and problematic singers throwing chairs off rooftop bars. Booth brings a realness and authenticity to the table of country music.
        Booth released three singles in the run up to release day – “Cigarettes,” “True Love,” and “Sometimes” – but the song that stands out and is very much as the centrepiece of the album is “I Let Him Love Me.” </p>
