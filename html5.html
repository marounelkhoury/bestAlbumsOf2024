        NASHVILLE, TENN. – Big Loud’s esteemed visionary ERNEST releases his highly-anticipated sophomore album, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE.  On the heels of his 2024 ACM Award nominations for New Male Artist of the Year and Artist-Songwriter of the Year, he pays homage across the 26-track project to his hometown and the creatives that make up the fabric of Music City.
    
        “I was born and raised in Nashville,” shares ERNEST. “I love this city, it’s the country music capital of the world, and this album is a positive affirmation in the name of country music. That country at its core, the songwriting and storytelling, is popular again.”
        
        Joining Jan Crawford of CBS Mornings in Nashville for an in-depth profile on the project, the 2X Variety Hitmaker and CMA Triple Play Award winner spoke about his background as a songwriter of nine No. 1 singles for artists including Jelly Roll, Sam Hunt, Kane Brown, Morgan Wallen, and Chris Lane, as well as the process of creating NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE. Watch the interview HERE.
        
        In support of NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, he will also be making his national TV performance debut on Live With Kelly and Mark (4/16) as well as performances on The Kelly Clarkson Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live! this month before heading to perform at California’s biggest country festival, Stagecoach.
        
        Produced by Joey Moi, the project brings to life the musical vision of one the modern era’s most impactful country hitmakers, earning early praise with a Tennessean cover story which notes “more than any performer, ERNEST best represents how, in the next decade, the communal spirit driving country music in Nashville will likely redefine popular culture worldwide.”
        
        With over a billion global on-demand streams, the Pollstar cover star proves to be more than just a game changing behind-the-scenes force who helped define a generation, but also a maverick that “creates a sound all his own” (Pollstar). NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE is the follow up to ERNEST’s 2021 debut album, FLOWER SHOPS (THE ALBUM), which featured the 2X Platinum title-track “Flower Shops (feat. Morgan Wallen)” and gave fans a glimpse of ERNEST’s edgy artistic styling.</p>
