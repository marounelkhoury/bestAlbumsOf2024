    <p>In March 2023, it was announced that Kelly had signed a recording contract with Epic Records. She began releasing tracks from her upcoming fifth album (including the singles "Missin U", "Cut", and "Young Gun") before compiling them on an extended play of the same title, Tori (2023). In the fall of 2023, she embarked on the Take Control Tour in support of the EP.

        Kelly felt she had finished work on the album in early 2023 after several sessions with singer-songwriter Jon Bellion. However, she was inspired to write the lead single "High Water", after suffering a health emergency due to blood clots in her legs and lungs that July. The track was released on February 9, 2024.
        
        She embarked on the Purple Skies Tour in support of the album, with the first leg starting on April 12, 2024, in Ventura and concluding on May 3, 2024, in Kansas City. She started the second part of the tour on August 17, 2024 in Taipei, Taiwan and will conclude on December 9, 2024 in London, England.
