The second single, "Alma Mater", was released on November 15, featuring uncredited guest vocals and writing credits by American singer Lana Del Rey. The album was officially announced the same day. It was followed by the third single, "Tiny Moves", on January 17, 2024, with an accompanying music video starring Antonoff and his spouse, Margaret Qualley. The fourth and final single, "Me Before You", was released on February 22, which is according to Antonoff, a soft, "Streets of Philadelphia"â€“style song about the personal growth needed to begin a meaningful relationship, contrasting Antonoff's historical emotional drama with his contentment at Qualley asking him when he will be home for dinner.
